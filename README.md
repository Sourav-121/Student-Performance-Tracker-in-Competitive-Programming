## Abstract
This project shows student progress by tracking their accounts across various competitive programming platforms and contests.By utilizing the Agile methodology, it ensures flexibility and continuous improvement to meet the evolving needs of the learners.

## Introduction
The "Student Performance Tracker in Competitive Programming" project is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for monitoring and improving student progress in competitive programming. By tracking student accounts across various competitive programming platforms and contests, the project offers valuable insights into their performance, highlighting areas of strength and opportunities for improvement. The use of Agile methodology ensures that the project remains flexible and adaptive, continuously evolving to meet the changing needs of students and educators. With a user-friendly interface, the project facilitates easy access to performance data, fostering a supportive environment for skill development and academic success.

## Objectives 
- **Monitor Student Progress**: Track and analyze the progress of students in competitive programming by monitoring their performance across various contests and platforms.
- **Platform Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with multiple competitive programming platforms to gather comprehensive performance data.
- **Agile Methodology**: Ensure continuous improvement and adaptability by utilizing the Agile methodology throughout the project's lifecycle.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Create an intuitive and accessible interface for students and educators to easily navigate and interpret performance data.
- **Provide Tasks**: Offer specific tasks and challenges to help students practice and improve their competitive programming skills.
- **Leaderboard**: Implement a leaderboard feature to rank students based on their performance, encouraging healthy competition and motivation.


## SDLC Model: Agile Development Process
---
### 1. **Brainstorming and Backlog Creation**
- **Activities**:
  - Conduct brainstorming sessions with students and teachers.
  - Create user stories that define the functionality from the perspective of students and teachers.
  - Prioritize the user stories based .
  - Develop an initial project backlog, listing all tasks and features required for the project.
- **Backlog Items**:
  - User Athentication
  - Dashboard
  - Leaderboard Integration
  - Reporting & Analytics
  - Performance According to Different Platforms

### 2. **Design**
  - Develop wireframes and prototypes class diagram.
  - Design the system architecture.
  - Review and refine design documents.
  - Create a database schema using ER diagram.

### 3. **Sprint Planning and Development**
Break down the project into manageable iterations (sprints) and develop functional increments of the project.
  - **Sprint 1**:
      - Implement user authentication
      - Dashboard
      - Show performance progress
  - **Sprint 2**:
      - Leaderboard
      - Integrate with different platforms of competitive programming
  - **Sprint 3**:
      - Role-base acces (Admin, Teacher, Student, Adviser)
      - Task Provider 

### 4. **Testing**
  - Perform unit testing on individual components.
  - Conduct integration testing to ensure components work together.
  - Execute system testing to validate the entire system.
  - Perform user acceptance testing (UAT) with stakeholders.


### 5. **Deployment**
  - Deploy the final product.
  - Monitor the system post-deployment to ensure stability.

### 6. **Maintenance and Continuous Improvement**
  - Monitor system performance and resolve any issues.
  - Gather ongoing students' and teachers' feedback.
  - Plan and implement enhancements and new features.
  - Conduct regular updates and maintenance activities.

### Benefits of Agile Methodology in This Project:
- **Flexibility**: Agile allows for changes and adaptations based on stakeholder feedback and evolving requirements.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular retrospectives ensure the team continually improves processes and outcomes.
- **User-Centric**: Frequent interactions with stakeholders ensure the product meets their needs and expectations.
- **Transparency**: Regular updates and reviews keep stakeholders informed and engaged throughout the project lifecycle.
